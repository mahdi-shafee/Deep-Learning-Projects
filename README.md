# Deep-Learning-Projects
Practical projects of the Deep Learning Course offered by Prof. M. Soleymani at the Sharif University of Technology. 

CLIP Object Detection: Extracting candidate regions for different objects from an image using Faster RCNN Resnet, then finding corresponding regions for different queries by choosing the maximum cosine similarity between CLIP Encoding for the image regions and the queries.

FGSM and PGD: Training a Resnet model for classifying CIFAR10 dataset, then implementing untargeted and targeted FGSM and PGD from scratch and comparing the accuracy of these Adversarial Robustness algorithms.

Image Classification Using CNN: Implementing and training a CNN architecture for classifying CIFAR10 dataset.

Image Segmentation Using U-Net: Implementing and training a U-Net architecture for performing pixel-wise prediction image segmentation on CARLA self-driving car dataset.

MLP Classification from scratch: Implementing and training from scratch with Numpy for classifying the given 2D dataset.

Newton's Method Optimization: Finding roots of the given function using Newton's Method and observing the effect of different initial coordinates on the final answer.

Pretrain Resnet Using BYOL: Implementing BYOL adversarial self-supervision algorithm from scratch, training a Resnet18 network with and without BYOL pretraining for classifying STL10 dataset and comparing the results.

VAE GAN Diffusion Generative Models: Implementing VAE, GAN, and Diffusion generative models from scratch, training them on FashionMNIST dataset and comparing the results.
